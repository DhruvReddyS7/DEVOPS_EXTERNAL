| 5 | `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` | Creates or updates Kubernetes objects from YAML. |

### Q4 Practical Answer

**Aim:** Write a simple program in C, and push the code to GITHUB. Create a Jenkins Job for executing the program.

**Files:**
- hello.c

**Execution Steps:**
1. Create folder: `mkdir CProgram && cd CProgram`.
2. Create file: `vi hello.c`.
3. Push the project to GitHub.
4. Open Jenkins at http://localhost:8080.
5. Create New Item -> Freestyle project.
6. Under Source Code Management choose Git and paste the repository URL.
7. Under Build Steps choose Execute shell and paste the shell commands.
8. Save and click Build Now.
9. Use job name `CProgramJob`.
10. Branch specifier: `*/main`.

**Source Files:**

#### hello.c

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World from C Program\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Commands:**

#### GitHub push commands

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Added C Program"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/CProgram.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Jenkins Execute shell

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
```

**Expected Output:** Hello World from C Program

**Quick Fixes:**
- If Jenkins cannot access Git, install Git plugin and verify repository URL.
- If command not found appears, use absolute paths like `/usr/bin/python3`.
- If workspace is dirty, delete old files from Jenkins workspace and rebuild.
